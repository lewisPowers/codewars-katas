  <!-- Holiday VIII - Duty Free
  The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty
  free whiskey you would have to buy such that the saving over the normal
  high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.

  You will be given the high street price (normPrice), the duty free
  discount (discount) and the cost of the holiday.

  For example, if a bottle cost £10 normally and the discount in duty free
  was 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday cost £500, the
  answer you should return would be 500.

  All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down. -->
  <script>
    function dutyFree(normPrice, discount, hol){
      // count how many bottles needed for discount to equal holiday cost
      let discountAmount = normPrice * (discount * .01);
      return Math.floor(hol / discountAmount);
    }
