  <!-- You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old",
  where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

  Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

  Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example,
  the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old".
  The first character in the string is always a number. -->
  <script>
    function getAge(inputString){
      // return the girl's correct age as an integer. Happy coding :)
      return parseInt(inputString[0])
    }
  </script>
